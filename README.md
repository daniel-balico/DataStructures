# Data Structures and Algorithms

_This is a simple project for me to learn and master the core fundamentals of **Data Structures and Algorithms**_

**The recent version of the code contains the following:**

### Data Structures
 - Static Stack
 - Static Queue
 - Singly Linked List
 - Binary Search Tree
 
### Algorithms
 - Bubble Sort O(n^2)
 - Selection Sort O(n^2)
 - Insertion Sort O(n^2)
 - Merge Sort O(n log n)
 - Quick Sort O(n log n)
 - Tim Sort O(n log n)
 - Radix Sort log l base b ( O(n + b) )

### How to run?
> Open CMD/Terminal and type "main.py"
